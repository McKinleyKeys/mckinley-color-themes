## McKinley's Custom Color Themes

This repository contains a Visual Studio Code extension that provides 3 color themes:
- Obsidian (light)
- Watermelon (dark, inspired by Monokai Pro)
- Lime (dark)

It also provides actions, which you can activate through the command palette, for quickly switching between themes.
